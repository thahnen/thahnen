# Well hello there!

## Who am I?

My name is Tobi and I'm working as a main developer on [SonarLint for Eclipse](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-eclipse).
Next to that I'm focussed on all other SonarLint flavors and libraries excluding *SonarLint for Visual Studio* and
*SonarLint for Visual Studio Code*. Next to that I'm also up for some programming in my freetime, here is a small
overview about my (personal) work!

### Gradle & Ant

While working with different build systems most of my day I'm most familiar with [Gradle](https://gradle.org) and
[Ant](https://ant.apache.org).

- [RunTestsSeparateJVMPlugin](https://github.com/thahnen/RunTestsSeparateJVMPlugin) to run unit tests in a separate JVM (in parallel or sequentially)
- [ManifestPlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/ManifestPlugin) to standardize the the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF attributes of Java archives
- [Ant wrapper](https://github.com/thahnen/ant-wrapper) as an equivalent to the Maven / Gradle wrapper (requires no Apache Ant installation)
- [VB6Ant](https://github.com/thahnen/VB6Ant) to build Visual Basic Classic projects in automation environments (e.g. locally or build environment)

### Eclipse plugins

As someone preffering JetBrains IDEs over everything else, I'm still committed to work with Eclipse IDEs and I'm also
familiar with building Eclipse plug-ins:

- [VISUSGradlePlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/VISUSGradlePlugin) as an extension to the Gradle plugin in Eclipse
- [AbstractUnitRunner](https://github.com/thahnen/AbstractUnitRunner) for creating runner for abstract classes

### Python

My swiss army knife and weapon of choice next to Kotlin, [Python](https://www.python.org) is the language I consider
myself the best at. I use it for 10+ years now!

- [GitOfHolding](https://github.com/thahnen/GitOfHolding) is a tool to automate the backup of some old D&D computer games
- [throws](https://github.com/thahnen/throws) is a small library to emulate the Kotlin *throws(...)* annotation / decorator
