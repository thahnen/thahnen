## Who am I?

My name is [Tobi](www.linkedin.com/in/thahnen) and I'm working at
**[DIMATE GmbH](https://github.com/DIMATE-GmbH)** as a *Senior Software Developer*,
working on our *PACS* and *Viewer Pro* software to digitalize NDT processes.

I'm working on the applications written in **Java**, **Visual C++**, and
**Delphi**, mostly focussing on the backend technologies and less on the UI.
Additionally, I'm focussed on our Build Infrastructure to enable our developers
to work with a maintainable and future-proof software solution.

## Previous work

Previously, I was working at **[Sonar](https://www.sonarsource.com)** as the
main Software Developer on *[SonarQube for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/sonarlint)*,
also known as *SonarLint*, as well as our other IDE plug-ins and support
libraries. I also had the pleasure to work alongside our static analysis
experts great folks on the analyzer for
*[Visual Basic Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic))*.

Before that I was working at **[VISUS Health IT GmbH](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH)**,
**DIMATE GmbH** being a spin-off of that, on the Build Infrastructure as well
as developer-facing tooling.

## Personal work

In my spare time I'm developing software as well, mostly on a *hobby*-level,
focussing on **Build Systems**, **Static Analysis**, **Eclipse IDE Plug-ins**,
**Undead Programming Languages**, and tools that make my life better.

### Build Systems

Working mostly with JVM-languages like *Java* or *Kotlin*, I'm focussing on the
main Build Systems, being [Ant](https://ant.apache.org),
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org), and [Gradle](https://gradle.org). Having
heavy experience using them as well as writing various kinds of Plug-ins:

- [RunTestsSeparateJVMPlugin](https://github.com/thahnen/RunTestsSeparateJVMPlugin) for Gradle to
  run unit tests in a separate JVM (in parallel or sequentially)
- [ManifestPlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/ManifestPlugin) to standardize the the
  META-INF/MANIFEST.MF attributes of Java archives
- [Gradle2Ant](https://github.com/thahnen/Gradle2Ant) for mixed Ant-Gradle builds
- [VB6Ant](https://github.com/thahnen/VB6Ant) to have a build system for *Visual Basic Classic*
  projects

### Eclipse plug-ins / RCP

While working daily with Eclipse, I'm also eager to build plug-ins as well as RCP applications
based on the Eclipse ecosystem:

- [VISUSGradlePlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/VISUSGradlePlugin) as an extension to
  the Gradle plugin in Eclipse
- [AbstractUnitRunner](https://github.com/thahnen/AbstractUnitRunner) for creating runner for
  abstract classes
- [SonarLint for XCode](https://github.com/thahnen/sonarlint-xcode) as a prototype for creating
  a specific flavour for XCode

### Miscellaneous

The bits and peaces that belong nowhere but are still kind of interesting. Mostly build with
[Python](https://www.python.org), the language I'm using for over 10+ years now!

- [SonarQube plug-in for JXA](https://github.com/thahnen/sonar-jxa) is a plug-in with rules for
  *[JavaScript for Automation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/Articles/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014508-CH111-SW1)*
- [GitOfHolding](https://github.com/thahnen/GitOfHolding) is a tool to automate the backup of some
  old D&D computer games
- [throws](https://github.com/thahnen/throws) is a small library to emulate the Kotlin
  *throws(...)* annotation / decorator
- [Minecraft PC Gamer Demo on macOS](https://github.com/thahnen/rd-minecraft-pcgamer-demo) is a
  port of this Windows only Demo version from 2011
