## Who am I?

My name is Tobi and I'm working at **[Sonar](https://www.sonarsource.com)** as a main developer on
*[SonarLint for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/sonarlint)*
(see [GitHub](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-eclipse/tree/master)).
Nowadays I'm also investing more time into the other SonarLint flavours like
*[SonarLint for JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7973-sonarlint)* and
*[SonarLint for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode)*.

Next to that I'm focussed around the libraries that make up internal parts of *SonarLint*
(e.g. [Omnisharp](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-omnisharp)) and tooling to help in our
development and testing process. Here are some of them:

- *[sonarlint-eclipse-launcher](https://github.com/thahnen/sonarlint-eclipse-launcher)* containing
  useful utilities for day-to-day development of *SonarLint for Eclipse*
- *[sonarqube-local](https://github.com/thahnen/sonarqube-local)* containing useful utilities for
  working with local SonarQube instances

## Personal work

I'm also up for some development in my (spare) freetime, here is a small overview of what I'm
tinkering with! I'm hoping that one day
*[Visual Basic Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic))* will be concidered
*cool* again, as I like to develop with it from time to time.

### Build systems (mostly JVM)

While developing I'm touching build systems like [Ant](https://ant.apache.org),
[Gradle](https://gradle.org) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) every day. Therefore I'm most
familiar with all of them:

- [RunTestsSeparateJVMPlugin](https://github.com/thahnen/RunTestsSeparateJVMPlugin) for Gradle to
  run unit tests in a separate JVM (in parallel or sequentially)
- [ManifestPlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/ManifestPlugin) to standardize the the
  META-INF/MANIFEST.MF attributes of Java archives
- [Gradle2Ant](https://github.com/thahnen/Gradle2Ant) for mixed Ant-Gradle builds
- [VB6Ant](https://github.com/thahnen/VB6Ant) to have a build system for *Visual Basic Classic*
  projects

### Eclipse plug-ins / RCP

While working daily with Eclipse, I'm also eager to build plug-ins as well as RCP applications
based on the Eclipse ecosystem:

- [VISUSGradlePlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/VISUSGradlePlugin) as an extension to
  the Gradle plugin in Eclipse
- [AbstractUnitRunner](https://github.com/thahnen/AbstractUnitRunner) for creating runner for
  abstract classes
- [SonarLint for XCode](https://github.com/thahnen/sonarlint-xcode) as a prototype for creating
  a specific flavour for XCode

### Miscellaneous

The bits and peaces that belong nowhere but are still kind of interesting. Mostly build with
[Python](https://www.python.org), the language I'm using for over 10+ years now!

- [SonarQube plug-in for JXA](https://github.com/thahnen/sonar-jxa) is a plug-in with rules for
  *[JavaScript for Automation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/Articles/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014508-CH111-SW1)*
- [GitOfHolding](https://github.com/thahnen/GitOfHolding) is a tool to automate the backup of some
  old D&D computer games
- [throws](https://github.com/thahnen/throws) is a small library to emulate the Kotlin
  *throws(...)* annotation / decorator
- [Minecraft PC Gamer Demo on macOS](https://github.com/thahnen/rd-minecraft-pcgamer-demo) is a
  port of this Windows only Demo version from 2011
