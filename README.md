## Portfolio

Here a small overview about my work! Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/thahnen) for additional information and repositories.

### Gradle

I'm working with [Gradle](https://gradle.org) daily while at work and often also at home!

- [RunTestsSeparateJVMPlugin](https://github.com/thahnen/RunTestsSeparateJVMPlugin) to run unit tests in a separate JVM (in parallel or sequentially)
- [jUnitReportsPlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/jUnitReportsPlugin) to archive jUnit results (e.g. because of process restrictions)
- [ManifestPlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/ManifestPlugin) to standardize the the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF attributes of Java archives
- [NightlyTestsPlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/NightlyTestsPlugin) to make some unit tests only available in nightly builds (e.g. because of long runtime / integration tests)
- [Word2PDFPlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/Word2PDFPlugin) to convert Word documents to PDFs (e.g. technical documentation in the build process)

### Ant

I'm working with [Ant](https://ant.apache.org) also on a daily basis. Even though it is a bit outdated it outperforms Gradle in some areas!

- [Ant wrapper](https://github.com/thahnen/ant-wrapper) as an equivalent to the Maven / Gradle wrapper (requires no Apache Ant installation)
- [Gradle2Ant](https://github.com/thahnen/Gradle2Ant) as an interface from Ant to Gradle (Gradle on the other hand can load Ant build scripts)
- [VB6Ant](https://github.com/thahnen/VB6Ant) to build Visual Basic 6 (Classic) projects in automation environments (e.g. locally or build environment)

### Jenkins

I'm working wiht [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) nearly every time when trying to automate product builds but also various other processes. Otherwise I will use GitHub Actions to perform these tasks.

- [GemischteTuete](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/GemischteTuete) is a Jenkins shared library containing various helper methods and interfaces to some services

### Eclipse plugins

As someone preffering Jetbrains IDEs over everything else, I sometimes have to use this old legacy system called Eclipse to develop on plugins used by other engineers.

- [VISUSGradlePlugin](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/VISUSGradlePlugin) as an extension to the Gradle plugin in Eclipse (which is quite unstable)

### Python

My swiss army knife and weapon of choice next to Kotlin, [Python](https://www.python.org) is the language I consider myself the best at. I use it since 10+ years now!

- [GitOfHolding](https://github.com/thahnen/GitOfHolding) is a tool to automate the backup of some old D&D computer games
- [throws](https://github.com/thahnen/throws) is a small library to emulate the Kotlin *throws(...)* annotation / decorator

### Everything else

Various other projects I created over the years in various programming languages. You can see my skills developing throughout the yeas by looking at these projects.

- [MSWordEmulator](https://github.com/VISUS-Health-IT-GmbH/MSWordEmulator) emulates the MS Word COM objects used in the *Word2PDFPlugin (Gradle)*
- [Game of Dice Task](https://github.com/thahnen/gdt-allgpsy-publish) is a psychological behaviour test
- [RTDLH](https://github.com/thahnen/Offline-Labeling-Helper) is a tool to lable real time imagery
- [Tyche](https://github.com/thahnen/Tyche) is a quality control software using a 3D depth camera to find issues in production
- [Aiolos](https://github.com/thahnen/Aiolos) is a libary to find orientation of images
